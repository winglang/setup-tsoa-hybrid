# Good Stuff
- Fixed most cases of "zombies"
- `@dirname`, mainly for the controller globs
- `--watch` option for `wing it`
- TSOA is now a singleton, so the process of generating routes only happens once for all tests
  - Turns out this wasn't the biggest bottleneck
- a `cloud.Function` is exposed from TSOA allowing direct invocation of the function

# Easy Issues
- Automated AWS tagging
  - custom platform
- Compile everything at once
  - All stacks need to be singletons
- Improve TSOA-only iteration speed for `wing it`
  - Implement a dev server with `sim.Resource`
- non-sim combination of TSOA stacks results in monolith
  - Allow tsoa lib to be used as non-singleton

# Hard Issues
- Lack of TS<->Wing types
  - `@typescript` doesn't address this case (the tsoa controllers aren't the entrypoint)
- Automated process of deploying dev env and linking related resources
  - Need centralized config and a way to resolve it during preflight
